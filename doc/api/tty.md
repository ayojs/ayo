# TTY

<!--introduced_in=v0.10.0-->

> Stability: 2 - Stable

The `tty` module provides the `tty.ReadStream` and `tty.WriteStream` classes.
In most cases, it will not be necessary or possible to use this module directly.
However, it can be accessed using:

```js
const tty = require('tty');
```

When Node.js detects that it is being run inside a text terminal ("TTY")
context, the `process.stdin` will, by default, be initialized as an instance of
`tty.ReadStream` and both `process.stdout` and `process.stderr` will, by
default be instances of `tty.WriteStream`. The preferred method of determining
whether Node.js is being run within a TTY context is to check that the value of
the `process.stdout.isTTY` property is `true`:

```sh
$ node -p -e "Boolean(process.stdout.isTTY)"
true
$ node -p -e "Boolean(process.stdout.isTTY)" | cat
false
```

In most cases, there should be little to no reason for an application to
create instances of the `tty.ReadStream` and `tty.WriteStream` classes.

## Class: tty.ReadStream
<!-- YAML
added: v0.5.8
-->

The `tty.ReadStream` class is a subclass of `net.Socket` that represents the
readable side of a TTY. In normal circumstances `process.stdin` will be the
only `tty.ReadStream` instance in a Node.js process and there should be no
reason to create additional instances.

### readStream.isRaw
<!-- YAML
added: v0.7.7
-->

A `boolean` that is `true` if the TTY is currently configured to operate as a
raw device. Defaults to `false`.

### readStream.setRawMode(mode)
<!-- YAML
added: v0.7.7
-->

Allows configuration of `tty.ReadStream` so that it operates as a raw device.

When in raw mode, input is always available character-by-character, not
including modifiers. Additionally, all special processing of characters by the
terminal is disabled, including echoing input characters.
Note that `CTRL`+`C` will no longer cause a `SIGINT` when in this mode.

* `mode` {boolean} If `true`, configures the `tty.ReadStream` to operate as a
  raw device. If `false`, configures the `tty.ReadStream` to operate in its
  default mode. The `readStream.isRaw` property will be set to the resulting
  mode.

## Class: tty.WriteStream
<!-- YAML
added: v0.5.8
-->

The `tty.WriteStream` class is a subclass of `net.Socket` that represents the
writable side of a TTY. In normal circumstances, `process.stdout` and
`process.stderr` will be the only `tty.WriteStream` instances created for a
Node.js process and there should be no reason to create additional instances.

### Event: 'resize'
<!-- YAML
added: v0.7.7
-->

The `'resize'` event is emitted whenever either of the `writeStream.columns`
or `writeStream.rows` properties have changed. No arguments are passed to the
listener callback when called.

```js
process.stdout.on('resize', () => {
  console.log('screen size has changed!');
  console.log(`${process.stdout.columns}x${process.stdout.rows}`);
});
```

*Note*: On Windows resize events will be emitted only if stdin is unpaused
(by a call to `resume()` or by adding a data listener) and in raw mode. It can
also be triggered if a terminal control sequence that moves the cursor is
written to the screen. Also, the resize event will only be signaled if the
console screen buffer height was also changed. For example shrinking the
console window height will not cause the resize event to be emitted. Increasing
the console window height will only be registered when the new console window
height is greater than the current console buffer size.

### writeStream.columns
<!-- YAML
added: v0.7.7
-->

A `number` specifying the number of columns the TTY currently has. This property
is updated whenever the `'resize'` event is emitted.

### writeStream.rows
<!-- YAML
added: v0.7.7
-->

A `number` specifying the number of rows the TTY currently has. This property
is updated whenever the `'resize'` event is emitted.

## tty.isatty(fd)
<!-- YAML
added: v0.5.8
-->

* `fd` {number} A numeric file descriptor

The `tty.isatty()` method returns `true` if the given `fd` is associated with
a TTY and `false` if is not.
