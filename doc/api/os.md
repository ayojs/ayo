# OS

<!--introduced_in=v0.10.0-->

> Stability: 2 - Stable

The `os` module provides a number of operating system-related utility methods.
It can be accessed using:

```js
const os = require('os');
```

## os.EOL
<!-- YAML
added: v0.7.8
-->

* {string}

A string constant defining the operating system-specific end-of-line marker:

* `\n` on POSIX
* `\r\n` on Windows

## os.arch()
<!-- YAML
added: v0.5.0
-->

* Returns: {string}

The `os.arch()` method returns a string identifying the operating system CPU
architecture *for which the Node.js binary was compiled*.

The current possible values are: `'arm'`, `'arm64'`, `'ia32'`, `'mips'`,
`'mipsel'`, `'ppc'`, `'ppc64'`, `'s390'`, `'s390x'`, `'x32'`, `'x64'`,  and
`'x86'`.

Equivalent to [`process.arch`][].

## os.constants
<!-- YAML
added: v6.3.0
-->

* {Object}

Returns an object containing commonly used operating system specific constants
for error codes, process signals, and so on. The specific constants currently
defined are described in [OS Constants](#os_os_constants_1).

## os.cpus()
<!-- YAML
added: v0.3.3
-->

* Returns: {Array}

The `os.cpus()` method returns an array of objects containing information about
each CPU/core installed.

The properties included on each object include:

* `model` {string}
* `speed` {number} (in MHz)
* `times` {Object}
  * `user` {number} The number of milliseconds the CPU has spent in user mode.
  * `nice` {number} The number of milliseconds the CPU has spent in nice mode.
  * `sys` {number} The number of milliseconds the CPU has spent in sys mode.
  * `idle` {number} The number of milliseconds the CPU has spent in idle mode.
  * `irq` {number} The number of milliseconds the CPU has spent in irq mode.

For example:

      idle: 1072572010,
      irq: 30
    }
  }
]
```

*Note*: Because `nice` values are UNIX-specific, on Windows the `nice` values
of all processors are always 0.

## os.endianness()
<!-- YAML
added: v0.9.4
-->

* Returns: {string}

The `os.endianness()` method returns a string identifying the endianness of the
CPU *for which the Node.js binary was compiled*.

Possible values are:

* `'BE'` for big endian
* `'LE'` for little endian.

## os.freemem()
<!-- YAML
added: v0.3.3
-->

* Returns: {integer}

The `os.freemem()` method returns the amount of free system memory in bytes as
an integer.

## os.homedir()
<!-- YAML
added: v2.3.0
-->

* Returns: {string}

The `os.homedir()` method returns the home directory of the current user as a
string.

## os.hostname()
<!-- YAML
added: v0.3.3
-->

* Returns: {string}

The `os.hostname()` method returns the hostname of the operating system as a
string.

## os.loadavg()
<!-- YAML
added: v0.3.3
-->

* Returns: {Array}

The `os.loadavg()` method returns an array containing the 1, 5, and 15 minute
load averages.

The load average is a measure of system activity, calculated by the operating
system and expressed as a fractional number.  As a rule of thumb, the load
average should ideally be less than the number of logical CPUs in the system.

The load average is a UNIX-specific concept with no real equivalent on
Windows platforms. On Windows, the return value is always `[0, 0, 0]`.

## os.networkInterfaces()
<!-- YAML
added: v0.6.0
-->

* Returns: {Object}

The `os.networkInterfaces()` method returns an object containing only network
interfaces that have been assigned a network address.

Each key on the returned object identifies a network interface. The associated
value is an array of objects that each describe an assigned network address.

The properties available on the assigned network address object include:

* `address` {string} The assigned IPv4 or IPv6 address
* `netmask` {string} The IPv4 or IPv6 network mask
* `family` {string} Either `IPv4` or `IPv6`
* `mac` {string} The MAC address of the network interface
* `internal` {boolean} `true` if the network interface is a loopback or
  similar interface that is not remotely accessible; otherwise `false`
* `scopeid` {number} The numeric IPv6 scope ID (only specified when `family`
  is `IPv6`)
* `cidr` {string} The assigned IPv4 or IPv6 address with the routing prefix
  in CIDR notation. If the `netmask` is invalid, this property is set
  to `null`

<!-- eslint-skip -->
```js
{
  lo: [
    {
      address: '127.0.0.1',
      netmask: '255.0.0.0',
      family: 'IPv4',
      mac: '00:00:00:00:00:00',
      internal: true,
      cidr: '127.0.0.1/8'
    },
    {
      address: '::1',
      netmask: 'ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff',
      family: 'IPv6',
      mac: '00:00:00:00:00:00',
      internal: true,
      cidr: '::1/128'
    }
  ],
  eth0: [
    {
      address: '192.168.1.108',
      netmask: '255.255.255.0',
      family: 'IPv4',
      mac: '01:02:03:0a:0b:0c',
      internal: false,
      cidr: '192.168.1.108/24'
    },
    {
      address: 'fe80::a00:27ff:fe4e:66a1',
      netmask: 'ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::',
      family: 'IPv6',
      mac: '01:02:03:0a:0b:0c',
      internal: false,
      cidr: 'fe80::a00:27ff:fe4e:66a1/64'
    }
  ]
}
```

## os.platform()
<!-- YAML
added: v0.5.0
-->

* Returns: {string}

The `os.platform()` method returns a string identifying the operating system
platform as set during compile time of Node.js.

Currently possible values are:

* `'aix'`
* `'darwin'`
* `'freebsd'`
* `'linux'`
* `'openbsd'`
* `'sunos'`
* `'win32'`

Equivalent to [`process.platform`][].

*Note*: The value `'android'` may also be returned if the Node.js is built on
the Android operating system. However, Android support in Node.js is considered
to be experimental at this time.

## os.release()
<!-- YAML
added: v0.3.3
-->

* Returns: {string}

The `os.release()` method returns a string identifying the operating system
release.

*Note*: On POSIX systems, the operating system release is determined by
calling uname(3). On Windows, `GetVersionExW()` is used. Please see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uname#Examples for more information.

## os.tmpdir()
<!-- YAML
added: v0.9.9
changes:
  - version: v2.0.0
    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/747
    description: This function is now cross-platform consistent and no longer
                 returns a path with a trailing slash on any platform
-->

* Returns: {string}

The `os.tmpdir()` method returns a string specifying the operating system's
default directory for temporary files.

## os.totalmem()
<!-- YAML
added: v0.3.3
-->

* Returns: {integer}

The `os.totalmem()` method returns the total amount of system memory in bytes
as an integer.

## os.type()
<!-- YAML
added: v0.3.3
-->

* Returns: {string}

The `os.type()` method returns a string identifying the operating system name
as returned by uname(3). For example `'Linux'` on Linux, `'Darwin'` on macOS and
`'Windows_NT'` on Windows.

Please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uname#Examples for additional
information about the output of running uname(3) on various operating systems.

## os.uptime()
<!-- YAML
added: v0.3.3
-->

* Returns: {integer}

The `os.uptime()` method returns the system uptime in number of seconds.

*Note*: On Windows the returned value includes fractions of a second.
Use `Math.floor()` to get whole seconds.

## os.userInfo([options])
<!-- YAML
added: v6.0.0
-->

* `options` {Object}
  * `encoding` {string} Character encoding used to interpret resulting strings.
    If `encoding` is set to `'buffer'`, the `username`, `shell`, and `homedir`
    values will be `Buffer` instances. (Default: 'utf8')
* Returns: {Object}

The `os.userInfo()` method returns information about the currently effective
user -- on POSIX platforms, this is typically a subset of the password file. The
returned object includes the `username`, `uid`, `gid`, `shell`, and `homedir`.
On Windows, the `uid` and `gid` fields are `-1`, and `shell` is `null`.

The value of `homedir` returned by `os.userInfo()` is provided by the operating
system. This differs from the result of `os.homedir()`, which queries several
environment variables for the home directory before falling back to the
operating system response.

## OS Constants

The following constants are exported by `os.constants`.

*Note*: Not all constants will be available on every operating system.
