# Ayo.js Community Values

Ayo.js is about the humans that help make it happen. It's a project aimed at
creating a new foundation of project governance and management that brings
**humans** and their concerns front and center.

You can pronounce it however you want: be it “ey-yo”, “I-oh”, or “Awooooo” — the
Ayo.js project strives to create an environment where you can feel at home and
focus on your contributions to this nice shared space that we all benefit from.

## Ayo.js is more than the code in its repository.

Documentation, long-term support, translations and localizations,
package management, libuv, V8 and Chakra, builds/ops, testing and its
infrastructure, hardware and IoT, Android, streams, community events,
facilitation, moderation and education. These and more are all concerns that
can be handled separately and by members who might be much better qualified
for these individual tasks than a central decision body.

Ayo.js will to go further than Node.js did in spreading responsibility across
the project, so everyone can focus and specialize better than before.
Contributors should be able to organize and manage their own subprojects
in a way that is effective and efficient for their unique needs.

## Humans are more important than red tape.

If governance policy is not serving the values set forth here, that governance
policy should change with the required agility. Following the governance policy
to the letter will not take precedence over staying true to our stated values or
the well-being of our humans.

## Humans are more important than APIs and Benchmarks.

Technical discussions are difficult, especially in large communities with
members with all sorts of perspectives. You are bound to find yourself in
situations with no clear consensus, with new concerns being brought up
on a regular basis, and things that might seem insignificant in other
contexts suddenly exploding.

The Ayo.js project’s perspective is that when such things happen, it often takes
a toll on the well-being of the members participating, at times preventing
repeated contributions or precluding new contributors outright. It also
recognizes that the difference between individual choices is less important than
the ability to come to a appropriate technical decision.

Projects change, evolve, and find themselves dealing with new concerns all the
time. In all technical matters, Ayo.js will take into account that in the end,
it is the people making, implementing, and maintaining that matter most, not the
decisions themselves. It’s okay for code to be imperfect.

## Humans are more important than corporations.

All sorts of corporations and other organizations around the world use and
benefit from the software underlying Ayo.js, and many contributors, in fact, may
be directly compensated by them for their efforts on the project. But this can
often turn into such direct reliance on corporations that they can essentially
seize control of a project — or struggle for power over it while individual
contributors are left wondering if they can ever influence the project
themselves.

Ayo.js will explore new structures and framings for corporate relationships
in such a way that its individual humans, not the corporations that employ them,
are ultimately still the ones determining the direction of the project.
Ayo.js should be a space where independent contributors, freelancers, hobbyists,
and students all feel like they hold the same footing as corporate employees
at all levels of the project.
