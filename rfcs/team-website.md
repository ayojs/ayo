# RFC - Establishment of a Website Team

This RFC proposes that a new team responsible for the Ayo.js website be created.
This team has the following responsibilities:

- The creation and maintenance of the Ayo.js website
  - This includes every aspect of it: Design, Code, Contents, etc.
- Reviewing and approving content additions to the website
- Coordinating with other teams on website content (for example a team
  that is responsible for documentation)
- Coordinating with the core team on the representation of overall project
  values on the website

To fulfill these tasks, the team is granted the following privileges:

- Ownership over the `ayojs/ayojs.tech` GitHub repository
- Rights management for the `ayojs/ayojs.tech` GitHub repository
- Control over the membership of the `@ayojs/website` GitHub team
- Ownership of the `ayojs.tech` domain

Team membership is managed on a volunteer basis. Any contributor to the team's
efforts can volunteer for team membership, or be nominated by an existing team
member. All nominations are publicly reviewed and voted on by the team.

The team may grant commit access to the `ayojs/ayojs.tech` repository to
recognize the efforts of contributors.
